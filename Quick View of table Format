| 01-01-2021 | Bengalureans gear up for 2021 armed with hope and learnings of 2021       | The year gone by brought with it unprecedented changes and events, many of which literally threw us all off our game and brought the world to a standstill. Yet, despite all the obstacles that we have had to face, everyone’s looking forward to the new year with hope and positivity. Bangalore Times talks to people from different walks of life about the year gone by and their hopes for 2021.After a year of challenges, I wish we get over the pandemic: Isha PantOccupation: Deputy Commissioner of Police, Command Centre Bengaluru2020 in a nutshell:The year was quite a challenge as far as policing goes, as the pandemic was something we had never encountered and each day came with a new learning.We had never been in or enforced a total lockdown like this before, so a lot of training was required. Police personnel on the ground had a tough time, as they were worried about inadvertently exposing their families to COVID-19 as they were out day and night enforcing the lockdown and dealing with the migrant situation. There was stress and trauma, and we learnt that we had to take care of ourselves first to be able to take care of the rest of the force and our near-and-dear ones. On the personal front, I lost an uncle to COVID-19. But as the year went by, I was able to reflect on the personal and spiritual growth I have had.What I want from 2021:Happiness and peace and a renewed faith in science. I hope scientists across the world are able to make breakthroughs and get us over this pandemic. But, most importantly, irrespective of how 2021 pans out, we need to remember the learnings we have had in 2020.The year taught me to introspect my role as an artiste: Matangi PrasanOccupation: Bharatanatyam danseuse and actress2020 in a nutshell:When the pandemic hit we were all clueless and trying to figure out what happened. As a performing artiste, realising that I would not be able to do that and engage with audiences was quite a blow. As a teacher, I was not even able to see my students. The time that I had during the lockdown, lead to periods of introspection - deciding my role as a citizen, as an artiste in society and where art falls amid all this. For artistes, it was a year of adapting to the situation and getting more equipped as performances moved from a live audience at a venue to a small screen and other digital platforms from your home. Our vision changed, creativity peaked and led to more collaborations, which was encouraging.What I want from 2021:I crave to meet an audience and engage with them again. Hopefully, platforms for performing arts will open up and help us escape reality and stress through our art. And last, but not the least, I hope people are more sensitive towards each other.Adapting to online classes was far from easy: Vedant TripathiOccupation: Engineering student at CMR Institute Of Technology2020 in a nutshell:It was a hard year for students. We had to return to our hometowns and did not know what would happen, how long would it last, etc. Then came the stress of adapting to learning complex subjects online, which was not as optimal as an offline class.What I want from 2021:I hope 2021 lifts off in a positive way and the vaccine reaches everyone in every nook and cranny of India, that we can get on with life as it was in the pre-Covid era.People should continue to follow pandemic protocols: Dr Shashank BSOccupation: Emergency medicine2020 in a nutshell:This was the year that really took a toll on medical professionals. As COVID-19 cases surged, doctors worked 15-20 days straight without a break, every day having to wear PPE kits, and then go for quarantine for the next 10 days before being able to head home. But, on a positive note, this once-in-a-century pandemic was quite a learning for the medical community and I am privileged to enter the medicine field at this time and be a part of the treating council and help patients with COVID-19.What I want from 2021:Hopefully cases reduce further and by early 2021 most of us might get vaccinated so that the exposure and the devastating effects are contained. I hope people do not take this pandemic lightly after the vaccine comes out and continue to follow the standard SOPs when going out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01-01-2021 | #UnlikelyHeroes: It feels so satisfying when peopleâs stomachs are full | I hail from a family of farmers from Vadivelampayalam, who also sold idlis and dosai. I, too, got involved in making idlis. It has been 50 years now.My day starts at 5am. I do everything on my own, right from grinding the batter and making piping hot sambar to preparing the chutney and serving fluffly idlis. I make around 600-700 idlis every day. My regular customers are predominantly from economically backward sections, including students and daily-wage labourers.So, I sell food at a modest price. I serve until 12 noon, after which I get busy with household chores. My grandson and his wife lend a helping hand.During the lockdown, too, when certain restrictions were lifted, I started serving idlis at the same price. I didnât want an unknown little virus to deter me from doing my job and let those dependent on me go hungry. It feels so satisfying when peopleâs stomachs are full.After the media spotlight, my kitchen got an upgrade with LPG connection, grinder and mixer. Until then, I used to grind idli batter and chutney using the traditional stone grinder. I now have three cylinders, but I still need one more due to the growing demand. I am not looking to gain any major profit from my business, which is why I have no intention of increasing the price. I am just happy feeding people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01-01-2021 | AP Arjun and Viraat team up once again after Kiss                         | After launching Viraat in the youthful entertainer Kiss, filmmaker AP Arjun is set to team up with the youngster once again for another film. The director has chosen to reveal details about the film on the first day of the new year as he thinks it will be a positive start to a productive year. Arjun says, "I will be teaming up with Viraat once again. While there is no title yet, we are looking at kickstarting the project by the end of January.The film will be shot at locations across Bengaluru, Mangaluru, Nainital and Ooty. We are yet to rope in the female lead for the film."Arjun adds that while Kiss was a story tailored to suit youngsters, this new project will be very different. "Viraat was like a young college goer in Kiss. The new film is an action drama and will see him drastically different from his look in Kiss. Viraat is currently working on his physique and will sport a muscular look, replete with six-pack abs. It will be a treat for the audience," says the filmmaker.Arjun adds that he is looking at mounting the project on a big canvas. "I am looking at a big-budget film that will be made with Telugu and Hindi versions as well," he signs off.

| 01-01-2021 | Bharath, Janani in a romance drama                                        | Bharath, who was last seen in the mystery thriller Kaalidas, has signed a few projects, and is about to begin work on one of them in a couple of days. Directed by Bharath Mohan of Igloo fame, the movie which will be set in and around Chennai, has been titled Yakkai Thiri. The film will have Janani Iyer and debutante Sonakshi Singh Rawat playing female leads.Says Bharath, âAs per the curent plan, the movie will go on floors tomorrow or the day after.Itâs been a while since I have done a love story, and Iâm happy to have landed this project. The film will be a treat for those who love to see me in romantic roles. It will be an emotional roller-coaster ride. Bagavathi Perumal also will be seen in a crucial role in the movie. My character, which has elements of suspense, and the friendship between the characters played by Janani, Sonakshi and Bagavathi will be the highlights of the project.â Bharath, who will be doing two more films after this with debutant filmmakers, adds that if everything goes well, Yakkai Thiri will be released in theatres.âUnlike the big stars which will have a huge chunk of audience waiting, the other stars have certain limitations when it comes to releasing their films in theatres. We are quite hopeful of people returning to theatres by the time our film is ready.â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

With a long line-up of films in Tamil and Telugu, thereâs no stopping Keerthy!Vijay Sethupathi, ActorThough he made his debut as a lead in the fag end of 2010, with the National Award-winning Thenmerku Paruvakaatru, Vijay Sethupathi has been one of the trendsetters of this decade, and it would simply be unfair to ignore him. The actor followed his debut with a striking performance in Sundarapandian and Pizza, which established him as a household name. Since then, VSP has never ceased to impress us. A middle-aged gangster in Soodhu Kavvum, an annoying lover boy in Idharkuthane Aasaipattai Balakumara, an aspiring rowdy in Naanum Rowdy Dhaan, a no-nonsense cop in Sethupathi, a hardened criminal in Vikram Vedha, an obnoxious villain in Petta, a still-in-love middle-aged photographer in 96, a transgender in Super Deluxeâ¦ the list of his outstanding performances is quite long. No wonder he has become a phenomenon in this decade.Pa Ranjith, DirectorA thinking filmmaker, Ranjithâs movies are not just engaging but also hold a mirror to the society. His stories are honest and realistic, like in Attakathi and Madras, seeped in reality, like in Kaala, with stylish filmmaking, like in Kabali, to boot. Even his production choices show his love for work that makes a strong statement against casteism and capitalism. The same goes for his initiatives that support local folk art. Heâs won an award for every film heâs directed, and is surely raring to go.Aishwarya Rajesh, ActressAishwarya owned this decade, quite literally. After starting out as a dancer in a reality show and doing tiny roles here and there, Aishwarya made quite an entry with Attakathi. She may have had debuted in the fag end of 2010 with Neethana Avan, but it was Pa Ranjithâs 2012 movie that made people sit up and take notice of her. And then, Kaaka Muttai changed her life forever. Since then, Aishwarya has become one of the sought-after actresses for realistic portrayals.Atlee, DirectorLike his films or hate them, you just cannot ignore them. Having assisted director Shankar in Endhiran and Nanban, Atlee made his debut with the sensational Raja Rani. He then joined hands with Vijay for Theri, which became one of the highest-grossing films of 2016. His subsequent successful ventures with Vijay â Mersal and Bigil â show that Atlee has got the pulse of the audience right. The young director is now making inroads into Bollywood as he is all set to direct Shah Rukh Khan in his next, tentatively titled Sanki.Karthik Subbaraj, DirectorWhat works for Karthik big time is his love for experimentation. He debuted with Pizza, a horror film with a twist, then went on to make a gangster comedy, Jigarthanda, followed it up with a silent thriller, Mercury, and then came up with a mass-y Rajini film, Petta. From starting his journey in a short filmmaking competition to now producing scripts that he has faith in, Karthik continues to surprise his audience.Santhosh Narayanan, Music ComposerHe worked as an arranger, programmer, recording engineer and was even part of a band, until he made his breakthrough with Pa Ranjithâs Attakathi. Since then, thereâs been no looking back for the composer. Santhosh dabbles in all genres under the sun, be it gaana or blues, and has a song for every situation, wedding or death. And his sound is so unique. Versatile much? Oh yes!Sid Sriram, SingerIf the phrase Veni, vidi, vici suits anyone, it would have to be Sid Sriram. The singer-musician literally came and conquered the hearts of many with his soulful and inimitable voice. Having started his career with a bang with AR Rahmanâs Adiye (Kadal), Sid went on to croon several hit numbers, including Thalli Pogathey, Yenai Maatrum Kadhale and Maruvaarthai.

| 01-01-2021 | Vimalâs action thriller to be shot inside Dr Rajkumarâs house         | We had told you that in 2019 Vimal will be acting in an action thriller titled Chozhanaattaan. The film, directed by debutant Ranjith Kanna, also has a historical element involving Rajendra Chozhan. The team, which is resuming shoot soon, is going to shoot inside Kannada cinema legend Dr Rajkumarâs house in Thalavady, reveals the director.âLike almost every other film, we had to put a pause on our shoot due to the coronavirus pandemic.We had shot the songs and had planned a schedule in March 2020, but had to call it off following the lockdown. We are now going to resume shooting in the third week of January,â informs Ranjith, adding that they will predominantly be shooting at the Kalvarayan Hills near Kallakurichi. âSo far, no Tamil film has been shot at Vellimalai in these hills and we are going to film there,â he adds. He is also planning to shoot some of the forest portions in Thalavady as well. âWe will be shooting inside the late Kannada cinema legend Dr Rajkumarâs house in Thalavady. We got permission from his family to shoot there and ours will be the first Tamil film to be shot in his house,â he states.The unit will be shooting a few action scenes and a few montage scenes involving the heroine during this 20-day schedule. Along with Vimal, Kishore, Ganja Karuppu, Sendrayan and heroine Karonya Kathrin will be part of this schedule. âThis will not be a typical Vimal film, a fun entertainer. It will be quite a serious one. He will be seen as a mentally and physically fit hero. Ganja Karuppu is playing a character that is not comical but a diabolical one who youâd curse for his actions. It will be as impactful as the one he did in Subramaniapuram,â he says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 01-01-2021 | Traveler Geethu Mohandas shares with us her hopes for 2021                | I am starting my New Year in the misty mountains of Kashmir, and I hope 2021 turns out to be as cool and comfortable as this place. My biggest hope for the year is that we get to travel safe and free, without wearing masks or using sanitisers, as we used to in the past! I also hope travellers get to explore as many places as they want to this year, without travel bans or health scares.At the same time, I hope tourists also remain responsible travellers in the New Year considering what the world has gone through in 2020.
